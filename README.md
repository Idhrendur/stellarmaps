Map icons are made by me. Basic shapes are released to the public domain, but others (Wormhole, Gateway, L-Gate, etc) are based on icons from the game Stellaris, and should not be used other than for tools or mods for the game.

# Local Development

[Follow the tauri prerequisites guide](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites). Install a recent version of Node.js. Then, in the root directory, run `npm run dev`.

## Electron

There is an Electron version available for local development. Some changes to the package.json are required. You can run `electron-on.sh` to make those changes, then run `npm run dev`. When you are finished, run `electron-off.sh` to revert the changes to package.json.

This exists mostly for debugging in Chromium. The release builds all use Tauri. Currently, the Electron version lacks the following features:

- loading data (localization, emblems, colors) from Stellaris mods
- loading non-English Stellaris localization
- translator mode
- (temporarily) country emblems
- production builds
